Of course. Here is the complete and corrected code for your GitHub Actions workflow file.

Copy this entire block and paste it into your `.github/workflows/predict.yml` file. It includes the `working-directory` fix for each script, as well as the standard steps for setup and committing the results.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/predict.yml

name: CFB Model Pipeline

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on a schedule (runs every hour).
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab.
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for specific paths.
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    paths:
      - 'scripts/**'
      - 'docs/input/**'
      - '.github/workflows/predict.yml'

jobs:
  run-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Python 3.11 and caches dependencies for faster builds.
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:

          cache: 'pip'
          cache-dependency-path: 'scripts/requirements.txt'
      
      # Step 3: Installs the Python packages required by your scripts.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
      
      # Step 4: Runs the dataset builder script.
      # The 'working-directory' is crucial for Python to find your packages.
      - name: Build dataset
        run: python -m scripts.build_dataset
        working-directory: ./
      
      # Step 5: Runs the model training script.

      - name: Predict
        run: python -m scripts.predict
        working-directory: ./
        
      # Step 7: Commits the generated data/model files back to the repository.
      # This step only runs if files in the specified paths have changed.
      - name: Commit and push artifacts
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'

          # Check if there are any changes to commit
          if git diff --staged --quiet; then
            echo "No changes to commit."
          else
            git commit -m "CI: Update model and predictions"
